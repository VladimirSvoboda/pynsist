# Streamlit deployment via `pynsist`

This is an example on how to deploy a streamlit app using `pynsist`. The example also includes the required packages to run plotly inside the app.

[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69352179/package-streamlit-app-and-run-executable-on-windows/69621578#69621578) you can find additional information on why the `src/run_app.py` has the chosen structure.

To properly run the app once installed, the environmental variable `WORKING_DIR` has to be set to the installation path on the Windows machine: `<installation-folder>/pkgs`.

The browser tab with the app should open automatically after a brief delay.
